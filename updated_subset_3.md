## Fiber Component Testing, Cleaning, and Quality Assurance

### Quality Assurance Requirements
Proponent MUST agree to replace or clean any fiber components that fail to meet GNB's requirements at the expense of the Proponent.

### Fiber Testing Standards and Methodologies

#### Visual Inspection Testing
*   **Standard:** `IEC 61300-3-35:2015` - Visual inspection of fiber optic connectors
*   **Equipment:** Fiber inspection microscopes with 200x magnification minimum
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** No visible contamination, scratches, or damage exceeding 0.5 µm
*   **Documentation:** Digital images of all connector end faces before and after cleaning

#### Insertion Loss Testing
*   **Standard:** `TIA-568-D.3` - Optical Fiber Cabling Components Standard
*   **Method:** `TIA TSB-140-A` - Additional Guidelines for Field-Testing Length, Loss and Polarity
*   **Equipment:** OTDR (Optical Time Domain Reflectometer) and power meter
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** Maximum insertion loss of 0.75 dB per connection
*   **Testing Frequency:** 100% of all fiber connections

#### Return Loss Testing
*   **Standard:** `IEC 61300-3-6:2009` - Return loss measurement
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** Minimum return loss of 35 dB for UPC connectors, 55 dB for APC connectors
*   **Equipment:** Return loss test sets or OTDR with return loss capability

#### End Face Geometry Testing
*   **Standard:** `IEC 61300-3-7:2012` - Measurement of end face geometry
*   **Parameters:** Radius of curvature, apex offset, fiber height
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** Within manufacturer specifications and `TIA-568-D.3` requirements

### Fiber Cleaning Methodologies

#### Dry Cleaning (Primary Method)
*   **Standard:** `IEC 61300-3-35:2015` - Cleaning procedures
*   **Equipment:** Fiber cleaning cassettes, cleaning pens, or cleaning cards
*   **Process:** 
    - Use dry cleaning for routine maintenance
    - Clean both connector end faces before mating
    - Use one cleaning cycle per connector
    - Inspect after cleaning with fiber microscope

#### Wet Cleaning (Secondary Method)
*   **Standard:** `IEC 61300-3-35:2015` - Wet cleaning procedures
*   **Equipment:** Isopropyl alcohol (99% purity), lint-free wipes
*   **Process:**
    - Use only when dry cleaning is insufficient
    - Apply minimal amount of alcohol
    - Use clean, lint-free wipes
    - Allow complete evaporation before mating

#### Automated Cleaning Systems
*   **Equipment:** Automated fiber cleaning machines
*   **Advantages:** Consistent cleaning quality, reduced human error
*   **Calibration:** Monthly calibration and maintenance required
*   **Documentation:** Automated cleaning logs and quality metrics

### Contamination Prevention

#### Environmental Controls
*   **Clean Room Standards:** `ISO 14644-1:2015` - Cleanrooms and associated controlled environments
*   **Air Quality:** Class 1000 or better for fiber termination areas
*   **Humidity Control:** 40-60% relative humidity
*   **Temperature Control:** 18-24°C (64-75°F)

#### Handling Procedures
*   **Standard:** `IEC 61300-3-35:2015` - Handling and storage
*   **Protective Caps:** Use protective caps when connectors are not mated
*   **Storage:** Clean, dry environment with controlled temperature
*   **Transportation:** Use protective cases and avoid exposure to contaminants

### Quality Control Documentation

#### Testing Records
*   **Test Reports:** Detailed reports for all fiber testing
*   **Calibration Records:** Equipment calibration certificates
*   **Personnel Certification:** Technician training and certification records
*   **Digital Records:** Electronic storage of all test data and images

#### Failure Analysis
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Systematic investigation of failures
*   **Corrective Actions:** Documented procedures for addressing issues
*   **Preventive Measures:** Implementation of lessons learned
*   **Trend Analysis:** Regular review of failure patterns

### Industry Best Practices

#### Pre-Installation Testing
*   **Cable Testing:** Test all fiber cables before installation
*   **Connector Testing:** Test all connectors before deployment
*   **Documentation:** Record all pre-installation test results

#### Installation Quality Control
*   **Real-time Testing:** Test during installation process
*   **Immediate Correction:** Address issues immediately
*   **Quality Gates:** Stop work if quality standards are not met

#### Post-Installation Verification
*   **Final Testing:** Comprehensive testing after installation
*   **Performance Validation:** Verify all performance requirements
*   **Documentation:** Complete as-built documentation

### Compliance and Certification

#### Standards Compliance
*   **TIA Standards:** Full compliance with `TIA-568-D.3` and `TIA TSB-140-A`
*   **IEC Standards:** Compliance with relevant IEC fiber testing standards
*   **ISO Standards:** Adherence to ISO quality management standards

#### Certification Requirements
*   **Technician Certification:** Certified fiber optic technicians
*   **Equipment Certification:** Calibrated and certified test equipment
*   **Process Certification:** Certified quality management processes

### Continuous Improvement
