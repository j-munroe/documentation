## 3. Cable Specifications

### Twisted Pair Cable
All Twisted Pair Cable MUST meet the following specifications:
*   All Terminations in accordance with `TIA-T568B` wiring schemes.
*   MUST at a minimum meet `TIA Category 6A` standards in accordance with `TIA-568-D.1` for Ethernet access speeds of 10-10000Mbps (10Gbps).
*   **Recommended:** `TIA Category 8.1` for future-proofing and support of 25Gbps and 40Gbps applications where applicable.
*   **Shielded Cable:** Use `F/UTP` or `S/FTP` shielded cable in high-interference environments.
*   **Cable Length:** Maximum channel length of 100 meters (328 feet) per `TIA-568-D.1` standards.

### Fiber Optic Cable
All fiber optic installations MUST meet the following specifications and installation criteria:
*   **Single-Mode Fiber (SMF):** The proponent MUST install and provision `ISO/IEC 11801:2017`, `OS2` grade fiber products at a minimum for optimal performance.
*   **Multimode Fiber (MMF):** Where specified, use `OM4` or `OM5` grade fiber for high-speed data center applications.
*   **Connectors:** Use `TIA-942-D-compliant`, `UPC/APC - LC` fiber connectors on all patch cables and cable plant components terminating equipment, unless otherwise specified.
*   **Connector Type:** `TIA-942-D-compliant`, `LC` Fiber Connector, 8.2 µm Single-Mode (`OS2`) or 50 µm Multimode (`OM4/OM5`).
*   **Polarity:** Maintain proper fiber polarity using `TIA-568-D.3` compliant methods.

### Splicing and Termination
*   **Fusion Splicing:** For Single-Mode Fiber (SMF), the proponent MUST use fusion splicing on all associated fiber path interruptions, connection points, and junctions, unless otherwise agreed upon.
*   **Splice Loss:** Maximum splice loss of 0.1 dB for SMF and 0.3 dB for MMF.
*   **Mechanical Splicing:** May be used for temporary installations or emergency repairs, subject to approval.
*   **Testing:** All fiber installations MUST be tested using `TIA-598-D` color coding and `TIA TSB-140-A` testing procedures.

### Performance Requirements
*   **Insertion Loss:** Maximum channel insertion loss as per `TIA-568-D.1` specifications.
*   **Return Loss:** Minimum return loss of 20 dB for Category 6A and 24 dB for Category 8.1.
*   **Crosstalk:** Meet `TIA-568-D.2` requirements for NEXT, FEXT, and ACR.
*   **Fiber Attenuation:** Maximum attenuation of 0.4 dB/km at 1310nm and 0.3 dB/km at 1550nm for OS2 fiber.

### Environmental Considerations
*   **Plenum Rated:** Use plenum-rated cable in air handling spaces as per `TIA-569-D`.
*   **Outdoor Installations:** Use outdoor-rated cable with UV protection for exterior installations.
*   **Grounding and Bonding:** Follow `TIA-607-C` requirements for proper grounding and bonding.
